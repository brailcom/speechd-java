=== Contents ===

- Java packages and classes, SSIP client implementation and auxiliary code
- Junit tests
- Ant build file to compile the code and generate documentation
- This READNME


=== Requirements ===

To use this interface in your java projects you will need:
- Sun JDK 5.0 or latter, or openJDK 6 or latter (The implementation uses java features not present in versions prior to java 5.0).
- Ant version 1.7.x or latter, previous version s should work but were not tested.
- Junit 3.8 if you want to run the tests.


=== Compiling and using ===
Use the provided ant build file, build.xml,  to compile the source and generate javadoc documentation with:
- Run ``ant compile`` or just ``ant`` to compile the java source files to .class files,this will output to the ``bin`` directory.
- Run ``ant jar``  to create a jar file from the compiled classes, this will output ``lib/speechd.jar``. Put this file on your java classpath to use this bindings in your project.
- Run ``ant doc`` to generate javadoc documentation from the source files, this will output to the ``doc`` directory. You will need the javadoc utility installed, this is present in most JDK distributions.
- Ant junit will compile and run junit tests
- ``ant clean`` will clean all compiled code and documentation.


To know more about the provided classes and methods We recommend generating the javadoc documentation and consulting it for reference, see the ``doc/index.html`` to start.
